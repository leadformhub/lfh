### H1
Lead Capture Features Built for Verified, High-Quality Leads

### First paragraph
LeadFormHub’s lead capture features are built for quality: OTP verification, branded forms, one dashboard, and analytics. Here’s what you get and how it helps your team.

---

### H2: OTP Verification for Lead Quality

#### H3: How Mobile OTP Verification Works
When a visitor submits a form with a phone number, you can require a one-time code sent to that number. They enter the code to confirm. Only then is the submission saved as a lead. No code, no lead — so every lead has a reachable number.

#### H3: Reduce Fake and Spam Leads
Fake emails and wrong numbers waste sales time. OTP verification cuts both. You get fewer junk submissions and higher confidence in every contact you follow up on.

#### H3: Configurable Verification per Form
Enable or disable OTP per form. Use it on high-intent forms like demos or downloads; leave it off for simple signups. You control where verification matters.

---

Your hub lives at leadformhub.com/yourbrand. All forms share that URL. No generic form provider branding. Visitors see your name and trust the experience.

OTP verification means the lead confirms their mobile number with a one-time code sent to that number. Only submissions that complete this step are stored as leads. You get reachable, real contacts.

Lead data is stored in secure, access-controlled environments. We use infrastructure and practices appropriate for business data.

## 7. GOOGLE FORMS ALTERNATIVE (/google-forms-alternative)

**Primary keyword:** google forms alternative for lead generation

### H1
Google Forms Alternative for Lead Generation: Professional and Verified

### First paragraph
Google Forms works well for internal surveys and simple data collection. For professional lead generation — branded forms, verified contacts, and one dashboard — LeadFormHub is built for that. A clear alternative when lead quality and trust matter.

---

### H2: Why Use a Dedicated Tool for Lead Generation Instead of Google Forms

#### H3: Professional Branding and Trust
Google Forms links and styling say “Google,” not your brand. For B2B lead generation, a dedicated tool with your branding builds trust and improves completion rates.

#### H3: Lead Verification and Quality
Google Forms doesn’t verify mobile numbers. LeadFormHub’s optional OTP ensures every lead has a real, reachable number. Fewer fakes, better data for sales.

#### H3: Centralized Lead Management
With Google Forms you often end up in Sheets and manual setup. LeadFormHub gives you one lead dashboard: filter, search, export, and optional CRM sync. Built for action, not just collection.

### H2: Professional Branding: Your Brand, Not Google’s

#### H3: Branded URLs and Custom Domains
Your hub is at leadformhub.com/yourbrand. Every form link carries your name. No forms.google.com in front of your prospects.

#### H3: Styling and Form Experience
Clean, professional forms that match your business. Customize fields and layout so the experience feels like part of your brand.

#### H3: First Impression for B2B Leads
B2B leads judge credibility quickly. A branded, focused form sets the right first impression and supports higher-quality submissions.

### H2: Lead Quality: Verification and Real Contacts

#### H3: OTP Verification for Valid Numbers
Turn on OTP per form. Submitters confirm their number. Only verified submissions become leads. Sales gets real contacts from day one.

#### H3: Fewer Fake and Spam Submissions
Fake emails and wrong numbers drop when verification is required. Your team spends time on real prospects instead of cleaning data.

#### H3: Better Data for Sales and Marketing
Verified leads mean better conversion and cleaner CRM. Export or sync to your tools with confidence that the data is actionable.

### H2: LeadFormHub vs Google Forms for Lead Generation
See the comparison table for a direct view: branding, verification, dashboard, pricing. When lead generation is the goal, LeadFormHub is built for it; Google Forms is a general-purpose form tool.

### H2: Built for Indian Teams: INR Pricing and Support
